#Learning Notes
Daily notes for what I'm learning.

## Git and Github
Learning command lines for git in the terminal
- git init: Creates a new repo
- git status: inspects the content of the working directory and staging area
- git add: adds files from the working directory to the staging area (can add multiple files in one line separated by space)
- git diff: shows the difference between working directory and the staging area
- git commit: permanently stores the file changes from the staging area in the repo
- git log: shows a list of all previous commits
- git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory
- git reset HEAD filename: Unstage file changes in the staging area
- git reset commit-SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history
